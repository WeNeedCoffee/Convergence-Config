/* The JSON object below should contain any overrides for icons.
 * The root is a map from mod IDs to objects,
 * containing one or both of:
 *   - A dictionary from item IDs to their icons, called items
 *   - A dictionary from armor material IDs to their icons, called materials
 * Both item IDs and armor material IDs can contain wildcards (*).
 *
 * Icon indices in this system start in the top left at 0 and wrap onto the
 * next row when another icon would not fit (after 28 9x9 icons in a row).
 * An index can be calculated using the formula `i = y*28 + x`.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     {"mycoolmod": {
 *         "materials": {
 *             "cool": 3 // Gold icon
 *         },
 *         "items": {
 *             "night_vision_goggles": 2 // Iron icon
 *         }
 *     }}
 *
 * The default icon configuration can be found in the JAR file under
 * `/assets/armorchroma/icons.json`. The icon image is stored under
 * `/assets/armorchroma/textures/gui/icons.png`. You may add icons to this file
 * using resource packs. */
